# # Constructors in Python: Welcome Message with Student Name

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that creates a **Student** class with a **default constructor** and a method to display a welcome message along with the student’s name provided by the user.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. **Get user input**: Accept the student's name from the user.
2. **Define the class**: Create a class `Student` with a default constructor (`__init__`).
3. **Default Constructor**: In the constructor, assign the user input (student name) to an instance variable `self.a`.
4. **Display Message**: Define a method `show` that prints "This is non-parameterized constructor" and a welcome message with the student’s name.
5. **Execute the Program**: Instantiate the `Student` class and call the `show` method.

## 🧾 Program
    class Student:
        def __init__(self,name):
            self.a = name
        def show(self):
            print(f"Welcome {self.a}")
    name = input("Enter the name of the student : ")
    s = Student(name)
    s.show()

## Output
<img width="1918" height="527" alt="503526148-042f9dea-6b49-4756-b910-d710cb36c008" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/679a1cee-a330-45bb-867c-56f8c2d5d8b2" />

## Result
Thus, The Python program that creates a Student class with a default constructor and a method to display a welcome message along with the student’s name provided by the user was executed succesfully.
